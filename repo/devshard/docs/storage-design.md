# Devshard Storage Design

This document records the storage decisions for devshard session state. It is
intentionally decision-focused: each section states the invariant, why it exists,
and the operational consequence.

## Goals

1. Persist every devshard session's metadata, diffs, signatures, finalized nonce,
   and settlement status.
2. Prune old local state with N=3 epoch retention without rewriting surviving
   epochs.
3. Use the same Postgres environment and partitioning style as payload storage.
4. Keep routing deterministic after restarts without querying the chain on every
   storage operation.

## Architecture

```
HostManager
  -> ManagedStorage
       -> HybridStorage (thin wrapper)
            -> exactly one backend chosen at boot:
                 SQLite  OR  Postgres
```

`NewStorage` in `devshard/storage/factory.go` picks the backend once per process.
See [Storage mode selection](#storage-mode-selection) and
[storage-modes-plan.md](./storage-modes-plan.md).

The storage interface lives in `devshard/storage/interface.go`. `CreateSession`
is the only method that introduces an `EpochID`; all later calls use `escrow_id`
and route through a local `escrow_id -> epoch_id` index.

## Decisions

### Epoch ID Is The Partition Key

Decision: `epoch_id` is `DevshardEscrow.epoch_index` from the chain.

Why: The escrow pins the session's epoch once. All diffs and signatures for that
escrow belong to that partition even if settlement happens after an epoch
boundary.

Consequence: If local storage sees the same escrow in two epochs, it is
corruption. The code must return an error rather than choosing a side.

Epoch `0`: the chain can set effective epoch index to `0`, and
`MsgCreateDevshardEscrow` stores that value. Storage therefore treats epoch `0`
as valid and does not use it as a missing-value sentinel.

### Postgres Mirrors Payload Storage Style

Decision: Postgres uses pgx/libpq env vars and declarative range partitions.

Tables:

```sql
devshard_session_index(escrow_id PRIMARY KEY, epoch_id)
devshard_sessions   PARTITION BY RANGE (epoch_id)
devshard_diffs      PARTITION BY RANGE (epoch_id)
devshard_signatures PARTITION BY RANGE (epoch_id)
devshard_snapshots  PARTITION BY RANGE (epoch_id)
devshard_sealed_inferences PARTITION BY RANGE (epoch_id)
```

Why: This matches `decentralized-api/payloadstorage/postgres_storage.go` and
keeps pruning as partition drops.

Consequence: Devshard parent tables are created once at process startup via
`MigratePostgres` in `devshard/storage/postgres_migrate.go` (payload parent
`inferences` uses `ensureSchema` in `payloadstorage/postgres_storage.go`).
Per-epoch child
partitions are created lazily on first write through `ensurePartition` only —
no `CREATE TABLE` on hot paths. `PruneEpoch` drops epoch partitions at runtime;
that is retention, not schema migration (also described in
[Schema Evolution Across Devshard Versions](#schema-evolution-across-devshard-versions)).
Range prune lists existing devshard partitions through `pg_inherits` and drops
only partitions older than the cutoff.

### SQLite Uses One File Per Epoch

Decision: SQLite stores routing in `_meta.db` and session state in
`epoch_<N>.db` files.

```
_meta.db
epoch_<N>.db
epoch_<N>.db-wal
epoch_<N>.db-shm
```

Why: Removing a whole epoch is a file delete, not a row scan or VACUUM.

Consequence: SQLite pruning closes the epoch pool, deletes the epoch DB and WAL
sidecars, then removes `_meta.db` rows for that epoch. Schema for `_meta.db` and
each `epoch_<N>.db` is applied at first open via `MigrateMeta` /
`MigrateEpochPool` (see
[Schema Evolution Across Devshard Versions](#schema-evolution-across-devshard-versions)).

### SQLite Reconciles Eagerly On Startup

Decision: `NewSQLite` reads `_meta.db` and then scans existing `epoch_*.db`
files to verify and repair the index.

Why: `_meta.db` is only a routing index. A crash can leave a session row without
a meta row, or a stale meta row without a session. Eager reconciliation keeps the
runtime path simple and makes corruption visible at boot.

Consequence: SQLite startup is not fully lazy. It opens epoch files during
reconciliation. With N=3 retention this is bounded by the intended operating
window; if old files accumulate, startup work grows until pruning catches up.

### Storage Mode Selection

Decision: At boot, `NewStorage` selects **one** backend for the entire process.
There is no per-request routing and no mid-run fallback between SQLite and
Postgres.

| Condition | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| `escrow_epoch` has rows in `_meta.db` | SQLite (drain transition if `PGHOST` set) |
| `PGHOST` set and meta empty | Postgres (boot fails if PG unreachable) |
| `PGHOST` unset, no `.pg-bound` | SQLite (fresh local store) |
| `.pg-bound` present, `PGHOST` unset | Boot fails (set `PGHOST` or delete `.pg-bound`) |

Postgres-mode boot writes `<storeDir>/.pg-bound`. While SQLite is draining,
boot logs a WARN when `PGHOST` is set and `escrow_epoch` still has rows.

Why: Dual-backend hybrid routing lost the in-memory route table on reboot and
could fork append logs when Postgres was briefly down.

Consequence: Postgres outage after boot fails operations on that store; it does
not silently create sessions in SQLite. SQLite → Postgres promotion happens when
`escrow_epoch` empties after settle/prune and the process restarts.

### Managed Pruning Starts After Recovery

Decision: `NewManagedStorage` constructs the wrapper only. Pruning runs on
**epoch change** (runtime-config publish / long-poll) via `PruneOnce`, plus one
catch-up `Start()` after recovery — not on a periodic ticker.

Why: Pruning before recovery can delete old-but-active sessions before the host
has had a chance to replay them. Epoch transitions are already observed on the
dapi event-listener path.

Consequence: dapi and `devshardd` wire storage in this order:

1. Create inner storage.
2. Run legacy migration.
3. Create `ManagedStorage` and register epoch-change → `PruneOnce`.
4. Run `RecoverSessions`.
5. Call `ManagedStorage.Start()` (one-shot catch-up prune).

Tests can call `PruneOnce` directly.

### Prune Cursor Advances Only After Full Success

Decision: `ManagedStorage` advances `prunedUpTo` only when the inner prune call
returns success.

Why: A failed backend must remain retryable.

Consequence: A failed prune leaves `prunedUpTo` unchanged so a later
`PruneOnce` can retry.

### Legacy Migration Is Resumable

Decision: `MigrateLegacySQLite` is idempotent at the migration layer, not by
weakening normal storage writes.

Why: Live duplicate nonces should still fail. Migration is the only path that
needs to tolerate partially copied rows after a boot failure.

Consequence:

- Existing destination session must match the resolved epoch.
- Existing destination diff for a legacy nonce is verified against the legacy
  row.
- Missing signatures are replayed with `AddSignature`.
- Conflicting copied data stops migration with an error.
- The legacy DB is renamed only after all resolved sessions are copied or
  verified.

### Escrow ID Is Pinned To One Version

Decision: `escrow_id` maps to exactly one `(epoch_id, version)` pair.

Why: `versiond` can run multiple `devshardd` versions at the same time, and
Postgres is shared across those processes. A request routed to the wrong version
must not attach to an existing escrow and replay it with different state-machine
rules.

Consequence: `CreateSession` is idempotent only when both epoch and version
match. Same escrow and epoch with a different version returns a version conflict.
Recovery also skips sessions whose stored version does not match the running
binary.

### Duplicate Create Metadata Is Not Rewritten

Decision: `CreateSession` is idempotent for the same `(escrow_id, epoch_id)` and
version and does not update existing metadata.

Why: The chain pins the escrow. Recreating a session should not mutate its local
state after diffs may already exist.

Consequence: Callers that attempt to create the same escrow with different
non-version metadata keep the first row. Conflicting epoch or version creates
return an error.

### Schema Evolution Across Devshard Versions

Decision: **Devshard session storage** uses a **forward-only, append-only**
migration list recorded in `schema_migrations`. Schema changes are applied
**once at startup** (or on first open of a per-epoch SQLite file), not on
request, diff, or payload write paths. Other dapi SQL (`gonka.db` /
`apiconfig`, `inference_stats` / `statsstorage`, off-chain `payloadstorage`)
keeps inline `EnsureSchema` (or equivalent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) at
boot and is out of scope for this framework.

Why:

1. **`versiond` can run multiple `devshardd` versions in parallel.** Escrow
   routing pins a session to one binary version, but **Postgres is shared**
   across processes — every version in the retention window may read and write
   the same database.
2. **SQLite per-epoch files are shared** when two versions still own escrows in
   the same epoch (`epoch_<N>.db` is not per-binary).
3. While any older binary in the deployed set may still touch a table, schema
   must remain **additive**: new tables, new columns (with defaults), new
   indexes — never in-place drops or renames on live tables.
4. **Destructive shape changes** use a new table (e.g. `*_v2`), dual-write,
   switch reads in the new binary, stop dual-write only after every active
   version has upgraded, and defer physical drop to a separate GC pass.
5. **Migration entries** live only in devshard `*_migrate.go` and
   `devshard/storage/migrate/`. They are append-only ordered steps; CI runs
   `scripts/check-storage-ddl.sh` to block stray `CREATE TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX`
   in store code and destructive keywords inside migration files.

Consequence:

- Implementers add a new `Step` with `id = max(existing) + 1`; never reuse an
  ID. New columns use `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` with a default or nullable
  type; new indexes use `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`. While an older binary may
  still write the table, do not `DROP`, `RENAME`, or narrow columns; do not add
  `NOT NULL` without a default.
- **`PruneEpoch` is not a migration.** It drops per-epoch partitions (Postgres)
  or deletes per-epoch files (SQLite) that no surviving binary still needs.
  That is bounded retention (N=3), not schema evolution.
- Lazy **`CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION OF`** for a new epoch is allowed only in
  `ensurePartition` (devshard Postgres; dapi payload Postgres uses the same
  pattern inline in `payloadstorage/postgres_storage.go`), not in migrate files
  and not duplicated on individual write methods.

#### Schema migration tooling

We use a small in-repo helper at `devshard/storage/migrate/` (`ApplyPG`,
`ApplySQLite`, `schema_migrations` table). We do **not** use `golang-migrate`
or `goose` for these stores — the schema surface is small and the critical
requirement is a strict forward-only contract across parallel binary versions.
`ApplySQLite` enables `journal_mode=WAL`; still assume **one devshardd process
per store directory** — two processes on the same `_meta.db` can race
`schema_migrations` despite per-step transactions.
Revisit an external tool only if a single store grows past roughly twenty
migration steps.

## Load Readiness

This design is not an early prototype. It is the production storage shape for
devshard session state under the assumption that every escrow lives inside one
epoch. The important production invariant is epoch-bounded lifetime: old shards
are removed by dropping an epoch partition or deleting an epoch file, not by
scanning individual escrows or nonces.

Schema is applied at **process startup** (and on first open of each SQLite epoch
file) through the migration helpers — not during steady-state reads or writes.
That keeps hot paths free of DDL and, together with the forward-only rule in
[Schema Evolution Across Devshard Versions](#schema-evolution-across-devshard-versions),
allows multiple `devshardd` versions to share Postgres and SQLite files safely
while any older version still holds unsettled escrows in the retention window.

For a high-load epoch with 1000 active shards and 100000 nonces per shard:

- Postgres is the intended production backend. The write path targets one
  epoch partition, uses primary keys on `(epoch_id, escrow_id, nonce)`, and
  prunes the full epoch with partition drops.
- SQLite remains a local single-process backend and fallback. It has one writer
  per epoch DB, so it is not the preferred backend for sustained multi-host
  production load, but it is still more stable than the main-branch SQLite
  layout.
- Recovery must be treated as a replay workload. At this scale, callers should
  replay diffs in nonce windows instead of loading a full 100000-diff session
  into memory at once.
- Migration must avoid per-nonce destination probes on clean first migration.
  It should resume from already-copied nonce ranges and verify existing rows
  only on retry.

The SQLite backend is still a concrete improvement over the main-branch
single-file SQLite store:

- Main branch stores all sessions, diffs, and signatures in one SQLite file.
  That file grows across epochs and is not pruned.
- This design stores each epoch in `epoch_<N>.db` and deletes old epochs as
  whole files.
- Main branch has no persistent `escrow_id -> epoch_id` routing key because it
  has no epoch partitions.
- This design has `_meta.db`, startup reconciliation, explicit conflict
  detection, and bounded retention.

So SQLite is not the target for the largest sustained deployment, but it is no
longer an unbounded local database. For local development and draining legacy
SQLite state during a Postgres transition, it remains supported. Data growth is
bounded by retained epochs and pruning is file-level.

Production deployments target Postgres-only mode (`PGHOST` set, empty
`escrow_epoch`). SQLite is not used as a runtime fallback when Postgres goes
down after boot.

## Operational Notes

- Postgres env vars: `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`.
- Postgres connect deadline at boot: `PG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` default `2s`.
- Storage mode helpers and `.pg-bound`: `devshard/storage/storage_mode.go`.
- Drain check: `HasSQLiteSessions(storeDir)` or presence of rows in `_meta.db` `escrow_epoch`.
- Production retention is `retain=3`: current epoch plus two previous epochs.
- No SQLite VACUUM is used for pruning.
